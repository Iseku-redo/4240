            <li><strong>Operational Costs:</strong> Maintenance, repairs, and ongoing expenses associated with green energy systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Return on Investment:</strong> Calculate potential savings on energy bills and any incentives or rebates available.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Consider the positive impact on the environment and the value it adds to your property.</li>
