        <h2>Information about Green Energy</h2>

        <p>Green energy refers to energy that is produced using environmentally friendly methods and sources. It is also known as renewable energy because it comes from resources that are naturally replenished.</p>

        <h3>Types of Green Energy Sources:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Captures energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar panels.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Harnesses the power of the wind to generate electricity through wind turbines.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> Generates electricity by capturing the energy of flowing water, typically through dams or water turbines.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Uses organic materials, such as plants and waste, to produce energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Taps into the Earth's internal heat to generate electricity or provide heating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages of Green Energy:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions</li>
            <li>Promotes Sustainable and Clean Energy</li>
            <li>Decreases Dependence on Fossil Fuels</li>
            <li>Creates Job Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector</li>
            <li>Minimizes Environmental Impact</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Incorporate Green Energy at Home:</h3>

        <p>1. Install solar panels on your roof to harness solar energy.</p>
        <p>2. Use energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs.</p>
        <p>3. Consider investing in a small wind turbine for your property.</p>
        <p>4. Explore geothermal heating and cooling systems for your home.</p>
        <p>5. Reduce energy consumption by practicing energy conservation habits.</p>
